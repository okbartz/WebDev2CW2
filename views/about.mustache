Our vison is to create a sustainable network of pantries providing low-cost food and wrap around services. The pantry is a dignified approach empowering communities to help themselves. The Pantry will support upskilling the community through volunteering and employability opportunities, with the shop itself being utilised as a training facility.
<br>
<br>
The Scottish Pantry Network will support the pantries by being the collective voice for change, we forge strong partnerships to support the development of the hub model, creating a tailored experience for local communities.  The Network will provide ongoing support to the pantries through compliance, lobbying and creating links with food suppliers.
